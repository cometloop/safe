# Interactive Demo Builder

- Add an etntry to the 'Interactive Demos' sidebar.
- Create a new page to show the demo

- Build this simliar to how `apps/documentation-website/src/components/todo-demo/` is done.
- Show a tab for the store.ts setup, app.tsx at minimum
- store.ts setup should leverage auto generated actions as much as possible
- setup commputed selectors as needed in the config in createStore
- showcase using a typescript type for the State and use satisfies ComputedConfig<State> for the computed config

- Show working demo first (Which contains the interactive app box, the subscription boxes, and sync read panel )
- Under that show the code (with the tabs to switch between)
