# Create docs for @cometloop/safe

## Goal

Take README from `README.md` and move it all into the `apps/documentation-website` website.

## Template I am using for this documentation site:

- https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/syntax
- it uses markdoc https://markdoc.dev/ so docs should be done accordingly

This template compes with tons of nice components already. Leverage all of them. There should be no reason or need to create new UI components. Only use components from this downloaded template. This template is defined for developer documentation.
